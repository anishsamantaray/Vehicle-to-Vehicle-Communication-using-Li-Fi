# Vehicle-to-Vehicle-Communication-using-Li-Fi

**ABSTRACT**

Li-Fi knows a light fidelity concept in the world. Li-fi is based on visual light communication. In that, we use an LED light emitting diode to transmit the data’s to the receiver side from the receiver side we used the photovoltaic cell to receive the data’s from the transmitter. LiFi the rated speed can reach until 14 Gbps. Onbody can hack this Li-Fi technology.

This project is concise in vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid accidents. We use the ultrasonic sensor, gas sensor, vibration sensor, and Li-Fi transmitter and receiver. The ultrasonic sensor is used to find the distances of the front vehicle and measuring the vibration level in the vehicle is done through the vibration sensor so that it could send the information if the car is overspreading or coming slow behind. The gas sensor measures the alcohol level of the driver to avoid drink and drive cases so that the other car drivers know that this driver is drunk. This data is sent through the Li-Fi transmitter to the receiver vehicle. Every vehicle has a receiver and a transmitter to transmit the data about their own vehicle and receive.

**Objective and goal of the project**

•	To develop a smart system that can detect the potholes and speed breakers present in the road.

•	Establish a communication between vehicles using Li-Fi Technology for avoiding road accidents

•	To avoid drink and drive cases in the society by using the gas sensor.

The Arduino Uno is connected with the breadboard which in turn is connected with the Ultrasonic sensor, Vibration senor and MQ-3. This is coded in such a way that if the car comes too near (for demonstration purpose it is taken to be 15-20cm) or vibrates when it is in one of the nearby vehicles or the driver has consumed alcohol. The light glows and data is transferred through it.
